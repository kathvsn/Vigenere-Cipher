# Vigenère Cipher

The Vigenère Cipher is a substitution cipher used for data encryption. The goal of the cipher is to avoid being susceptible to brute force and letter frequency analysis. To do this, the Vigenère Cipher consists of several Caesar Ciphers in sequence with different shift values based on a keyword, instead of just one key.
